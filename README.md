# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
A bit about myself: I am exploring and learning GitHub with the goal to obtain GitHub Certifications and become an active user in the GitHub Community.  Most developers are awesome peers to work with and I'd like to be apart of all that awesomeness.
